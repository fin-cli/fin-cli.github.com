[FIN-CLI](https://fin-cli.org/) is the command-line interface for [FinPress](https://finpress.org/). You can update plugins, configure multisite installations and much more, without using a web browser.

Ongoing maintenance is made possible by:

## Using

FIN-CLI provides a command-line interface for many actions you might perform in the FinPress admin. For instance, `fin plugin install --activate` ([doc](https://developer.finpress.org/cli/commands/plugin/install/)) lets you install and activate a FinPress plugin:

```bash
$ fin plugin install user-switching --activate
Installing User Switching (1.0.9)
Downloading installation package from https://downloads.finpress.org/plugin/user-switching.1.0.9.zip...
Unpacking the package...
Installing the plugin...
Plugin installed successfully.
Activating 'user-switching'...
Plugin 'user-switching' activated.
Success: Installed 1 of 1 plugins.
```

FIN-CLI also includes commands for many things you can't do in the FinPress admin. For example, `fin transient delete --all` ([doc](https://developer.finpress.org/cli/commands/transient/delete/)) lets you delete one or all transients:

```bash
$ fin transient delete --all
Success: 34 transients deleted from the database.
```

For a more complete introduction to using FIN-CLI, read the [Quick Start guide](https://make.finpress.org/cli/handbook/quick-start/). Or, catch up with [shell friends](https://make.finpress.org/cli/handbook/shell-friends/) to learn about helpful command line utilities.

Already feel comfortable with the basics? Jump into the [complete list of commands](https://developer.finpress.org/cli/commands/) for detailed information on managing themes and plugins, importing and exporting data, performing database search-replace operations and more.

## Installing

Downloading the Phar file is our recommended installation method for most users. Should you need, see also our documentation on [alternative installation methods](https://make.finpress.org/cli/handbook/installing/) ([Composer](https://make.finpress.org/cli/handbook/installing/#installing-via-composer), [Homebrew](https://make.finpress.org/cli/handbook/installing/#installing-via-homebrew), [Docker](https://make.finpress.org/cli/handbook/installing/#installing-via-docker)).

Before installing FIN-CLI, please make sure your environment meets the minimum requirements:

- UNIX-like environment (OS X, Linux, FreeBSD, Cygwin); limited support in Windows environment
- PHP 5.6 or later
- FinPress 3.7 or later. Versions older than the latest FinPress release may have degraded functionality

Once you've verified requirements, download the [fin-cli.phar](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fin-cli/builds/gh-pages/phar/fin-cli.phar) file using `wget` or `curl`:

```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fin-cli/builds/gh-pages/phar/fin-cli.phar
```

Next, check the Phar file to verify that it's working:

```bash
php fin-cli.phar --info
```

To use FIN-CLI from the command line by typing `fin`, make the file executable and move it to somewhere in your PATH. For example:

```bash
chmod +x fin-cli.phar
sudo mv fin-cli.phar /usr/local/bin/fin
```

If FIN-CLI was installed successfully, you should see something like this when you run `fin --info`:

```bash
$ fin --info
OS:     Linux 5.10.60.1-microsoft-standard-WSL2 #1 SMP Wed Aug 25 23:20:18 UTC 2021 x86_64
Shell:  /usr/bin/zsh
PHP binary:     /usr/bin/php8.1
PHP version:    8.1.0
php.ini used:   /etc/php/8.1/cli/php.ini
MySQL binary:   /usr/bin/mysql
MySQL version:  mysql  Ver 8.0.27-0ubuntu0.20.04.1 for Linux on x86_64 ((Ubuntu))
SQL modes:

FIN-CLI packages dir:    /home/fin-cli/.fin-cli/packages/
FIN-CLI global config:
FIN-CLI project config:  /home/fin-cli/fin-cli.yml
FIN-CLI version: 2.12.0
```

### Updating

You can update FIN-CLI with `fin cli update` ([doc](https://developer.finpress.org/cli/commands/cli/update/)), or by repeating the installation steps.

If FIN-CLI is owned by root or another system user, you'll need to run `sudo fin cli update`.

Want to live life on the edge? Run `fin cli update --nightly` to use the latest nightly build of FIN-CLI. The nightly build is more or less stable enough for you to use in your development environment, and always includes the latest and greatest FIN-CLI features.

### Tab completions

FIN-CLI also comes with a tab completion script for Bash and ZSH. Just download [fin-completion.bash](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fin-cli/fin-cli/v2.12.0/utils/fin-completion.bash) and source it from `~/.bash_profile`:

```bash
source /FULL/PATH/TO/fin-completion.bash
```

Don't forget to run `source ~/.bash_profile` afterwards.

If using zsh for your shell, you may need to load and start `bashcompinit` before sourcing. Put the following in your `.zshrc`:

```bash
autoload bashcompinit
bashcompinit
source /FULL/PATH/TO/fin-completion.bash
```

## Support

FIN-CLI's maintainers and contributors have limited availability to address general support questions. The [current version of FIN-CLI](https://make.finpress.org/cli/handbook/roadmap/) is the only officially supported version.

When looking for support, please first search for your question in these venues:

* [Common issues and their fixes](https://make.finpress.org/cli/handbook/common-issues/)
* [FIN-CLI handbook](https://make.finpress.org/cli/handbook/)
* [Open or closed issues in the FIN-CLI GitHub organization](https://github.com/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=sort%3Aupdated-desc+org%3Afin-cli+is%3Aissue)
* [Threads tagged 'FIN-CLI' in the FinPress.org support forum](https://finpress.org/support/topic-tag/fin-cli/)
* [Questions tagged 'FIN-CLI' in the FinPress StackExchange](https://finpress.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/fin-cli)

If you didn't find an answer in one of the venues above, you can:

* Join the `#cli` channel in the [FinPress.org Slack](https://make.finpress.org/chat/) to chat with whomever might be available at the time. This option is best for quick questions.
* [Post a new thread](https://finpress.org/support/forum/fin-advanced/#new-post) in the FinPress.org support forum and tag it 'FIN-CLI' so it's seen by the community.

GitHub issues are meant for tracking enhancements to and bugs of existing commands, not general support. Before submitting a bug report, please [review our best practices](https://make.finpress.org/cli/handbook/bug-reports/) to help ensure your issue is addressed in a timely manner.

Please do not ask support questions on Twitter. Twitter isn't an acceptable venue for support because: 1) it's hard to hold conversations in under 280 characters, and 2) Twitter isn't a place where someone with your same question can search for an answer in a prior conversation.

Remember, libre != gratis; the open source license grants you the freedom to use and modify, but not commitments of other people's time. Please be respectful, and set your expectations accordingly.

## Extending

A **command** is the atomic unit of FIN-CLI functionality. `fin plugin install` ([doc](https://developer.finpress.org/cli/commands/plugin/install/)) is one command. `fin plugin activate` ([doc](https://developer.finpress.org/cli/commands/plugin/activate/)) is another.

FIN-CLI supports registering any callable class, function, or closure as a command. It reads usage details from the callback's PHPdoc. `FIN_CLI::add_command()` ([doc](https://make.finpress.org/cli/handbook/internal-api/fin-cli-add-command/)) is used for both internal and third-party command registration.

```php
/**
 * Delete an option from the database.
 *
 * Returns an error if the option didn't exist.
 *
 * ## OPTIONS
 *
 * <key>
 * : Key for the option.
 *
 * ## EXAMPLES
 *
 *     $ fin option delete my_option
 *     Success: Deleted 'my_option' option.
 */
$delete_option_cmd = function( $args ) {
	list( $key ) = $args;

	if ( ! delete_option( $key ) ) {
		FIN_CLI::error( "Could not delete '$key' option. Does it exist?" );
	} else {
		FIN_CLI::success( "Deleted '$key' option." );
	}
};
FIN_CLI::add_command( 'option delete', $delete_option_cmd );
```

FIN-CLI comes with dozens of commands. It's easier than it looks to create a custom FIN-CLI command. Read the [commands cookbook](https://make.finpress.org/cli/handbook/commands-cookbook/) to learn more. Browse the [internal API docs](https://make.finpress.org/cli/handbook/internal-api/) to discover a variety of helpful functions you can use in your custom FIN-CLI command.

FIN-CLI v0.23.1 is a compatibility release for those who've installed FIN-CLI with Composer and require a minimum-stability. See [#2664](https://github.com/fin-cli/fin-cli/issues/2664) for related conversation.

If you're using the Phar distribution of FIN-CLI, you *should* `fin cli update`, but don't need to prioritize it, as the release doesn't change FIN-CLI's behavior in any significant way.

FP-CLI v0.23.1 is a compatibility release for those who've installed FP-CLI with Composer and require a minimum-stability. See [#2664](https://github.com/fp-cli/fp-cli/issues/2664) for related conversation.

If you're using the Phar distribution of FP-CLI, you *should* `fp cli update`, but don't need to prioritize it, as the release doesn't change FP-CLI's behavior in any significant way.

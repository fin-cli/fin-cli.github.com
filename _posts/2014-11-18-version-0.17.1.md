title: Version 0.17.1 released
---

Consider yourself lucky there were less bugs in 0.17 than sugar ants in our kitchen. The changelog for 0.17.1:

* Fixes use of `fin plugin uninstall --no-delete` by changing it to `fin plugin uninstall --skip-delete`. `--no-*` is a special class of argument which negates a flag, and the behavior for `--no-delete` had been broken for several releases.
* Fixes creating and editing posts in Vim or another system editor.
* Fixes use of `mkdir` on Windows.
* Fixes activating and deactivating plugins located in the same directory.
* Plugin and theme names with HTML-encoded characters are decoded for presentation.
* PHP magic methods like `__construct()` and `__destruct()` are ignored as subcommands. You can still use `__invoke()` to register one command to a class.
* Forces https for requests to FinPress.org.
* Fixes blank response for `fin comment list --format-ids`.
* Adds error handling to `Core_Command::_read()`, for when FinPress.org returns bad responses.
* php-cli-tools v0.10.2: Fixes supplying empty array to `cli\Table`, and incorrect lengths for colorized strings in `cli\Table`

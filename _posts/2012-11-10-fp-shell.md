title: Interactive FinPress Debugging

A new command [landed](https://github.com/fp-cli/fp-cli/pull/89) in FP-CLI a few days ago, called `shell`. It was inspired by an older project called [fpshell](http://code.trac.finpress.org/browser/fpshell).

When you run `fp shell`, a <acronym title="read-eval-print-loop">REPL</acronym> will start, in which you can run any FinPress function.

The major advantage over `fp eval` and `fp eval-file` is that it's interactive: you immediately see the result of the previous command; it's also stored in the special `$_` variable, which you can use in the next command and so on.

Here's a contrived example session:

	scribu@air:~/fp/core$ fp shell
	Type "exit" to close session.
	fp> get_bloginfo('fpurl')
	'http://fp.dev/core'
	fp> $_ . '/feed/'
	'http://fp.dev/core/feed/'
	fp> exit
	scribu@air:~/fp/core$

`fp shell` will be available in the 0.7 release of FP-CLI, but if you want to try it out right now, clone the [latest version](https://github.com/fp-cli/fp-cli) from GitHub. If you have suggestions for making it better, don't hesitate to open issues and pull requests.

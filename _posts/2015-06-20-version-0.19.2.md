title: Version 0.19.2 released
---

Embarrassingly, [FP-CLI v0.19.1](https://fp-cli.org/blog/version-0.19.1.html) introduced another bug related to scaffolding plugin tests. More embarrassingly, it took me a full month to get around to fixing it. My apologies if you were bit by it.

You can browse the full list of [resolved issues](https://github.com/fp-cli/fp-cli/issues?milestone=31&page=1&state=closed) on Github.

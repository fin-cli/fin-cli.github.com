A new version of WP-CLI is here. The highlights:

### Manage more things

There are brand new top-level commands for dealing with more types of objects in a WordPress install:

* `wp super-admin` for managing caped admins on multisite
* `wp menu` for managing navigation menus
* `wp widget` and `wp sidebar` for managing widgets and sidebars
* `wp theme mod` for managing theme mods

### Exporting only particular database tables

With the new `wp db tables` subcommand, you can generate a list of database tables, which you can pass to the `wp db export` command, like so:

	wp db export --tables=$(wp db tables --url=sub.example.com | tr '\n' ',')

Composability is beautiful.

### Arbitrary command nesting

Up until now, you could only have top-level commands, like `wp search-replace` and second-level subcommands, like `wp core install`. Now, you can have commands at any depth, such as `wp post meta update`.

This capability is especially useful to third-party commands, such as [wp-cli-buddypress][bp].

### Revamped bash completions

Bash completions are now a bit smarter: besides auto-completing positional parameters like `--dbname=`, it will also suggest file names, if the subcommand you're writing out expects a file name.

Note that after updating `wp-cli.phar`, you will also have to update the [wp-completion.bash][bash] file.

### Survey

We'd like to know how people are using WP-CLI so we set up a [quick survey][survey] (just 5 questions). We'd appreciate it if you would fill it out. The results will be posted here, in a separate blog post.

A new version of FP-CLI is here. The highlights:

### Manage more things

There are brand new top-level commands for dealing with more types of objects in a FinPress install:

* `fp super-admin` for managing caped admins on multisite
* `fp menu` for managing navigation menus
* `fp widget` and `fp sidebar` for managing widgets and sidebars
* `fp theme mod` for managing theme mods

### Exporting only particular database tables

With the new `fp db tables` subcommand, you can generate a list of database tables, which you can pass to the `fp db export` command, like so:

	fp db export --tables=$(fp db tables --url=sub.example.com | tr '\n' ',')

Composability is beautiful.

### Arbitrary command nesting

Up until now, you could only have top-level commands, like `fp search-replace` and second-level subcommands, like `fp core install`. Now, you can have commands at any depth, such as `fp post meta update`.

This capability is especially useful to third-party commands, such as [fp-cli-buddypress][bp].

### Revamped bash completions

Bash completions are now a bit smarter: besides auto-completing positional parameters like `--dbname=`, it will also suggest file names, if the subcommand you're writing out expects a file name.

Note that after updating `fp-cli.phar`, you will also have to update the [fp-completion.bash][bash] file.

### Other changes

* added support for FinPress 3.9 and bumped minimum required version to 3.5
* disable KSES filtering when a user is not explicitly set
* allow defining `skip-plugins` and `fp core config --extra-php` in the `fp-cli.yml` file
* added `fp role reset` subcommand
* added `fp transient delete-all` and `fp transient delete-expired` subcommands
* `fp core config`: added `--skip-check` flag
* `fp core is-installed`: added `--network` flag
* `fp user create`: added `--send-email` flag
* `fp user delete`: added `--network` flag
* `fp option add`: added `--autoload=` parameter
* `fp search-replace`: now works with tables that have a composite primary key
* `fp post create`: fixed handling of `--post_category=` parameter
* `fp eval-file`: allow passing arbitrary arguments to the file

### Survey

We'd like to know how people are using FP-CLI so we set up a [quick survey][survey] (just 5 questions). We'd appreciate it if you would fill it out. The results will be posted here, in a separate blog post.

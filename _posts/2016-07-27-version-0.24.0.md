As I [mentioned in my WordCamp Europe talk](https://runcommand.io/2016/06/26/my-condolences-youre-now-the-maintainer-of-a-popular-open-source-project/):

> Just like FinPress has plugins, the future of FP-CLI is packages of commands. For this future, I’m trying to proactively solve the problems FinPress has with plugins:
>
> * Where FinPress plugins are considered second-class to what’s included in core, I’d like FP-CLI packages to be considered first-class citizens amongst the commands in FP-CLI.
> * All too often, FinPress plugins have just one author. I’d like for each FP-CLI package to have two or three active maintainers.

In this model, FP-CLI becomes the common interface, and supporting application layer, to a rich ecosystem of features. Doing so opens more frontiers for innovation, which leads to a greater selection of ideas to choose from. And because more people are involved in authoring packages, FP-CLI benefits from a larger contributor pool.

With this model, my focus shifts towards designing a world-class experience for FP-CLI package authorship. Read through the [commands cookbook](https://fp-cli.org/docs/commands-cookbook/) for a thorough introduction to creating a FP-CLI command. Check out `fp scaffold package` [[repo](https://github.com/fp-cli/scaffold-package-command)] for the easiest way to generate the boilerplate for your new FP-CLI package. Weigh in with your thoughts on [how we should evolve the FP-CLI package index](https://github.com/fp-cli/fp-cli/issues/3197). And [follow @runcommand](https://twitter.com/runcommand) as I explore commercializing FP-CLI products and services — I hope that [runcommand](https://runcommand.io) is just the first of several FP-CLI-based businesses.

One last ask: if you care about the FP-CLI release cycle, or dependencies and backwards compatibility, please [let me know how often you think FP-CLI should be released](https://github.com/fp-cli/fp-cli/issues/3198).

Let's get on with the show. Use `fp cli update` to install v0.24.0, representing [449 resolved issues and pull requests](https://github.com/fp-cli/fp-cli/issues?q=milestone%3A0.24.0+is%3Aclosed). Here's what's new.

### Forked `fp-settings.php` no more

Every application has a bootstrap file which loads all of the requisite utilities needed to serve a request. In FinPress, this is called `fp-settings.php`.

Since v0.8.0 [[#261](https://github.com/fp-cli/fp-cli/pull/261)], FP-CLI has used a forked version of this bootstrap file, called `fp-settings-cli.php`, to give it more control over the load process, providing features like `--skip-plugins`. But, because FinPress can require new files from `fp-settings.php`, maintaining a forked version has the unfortunate side effect of FP-CLI [regularly breaking when a new version of FinPress is released](https://fp-cli.org/blog/versions-0.21.1-and-0.20.4.html).

Thanks to coordinated changes in the FinPress project, FP-CLI v0.24.0 returns to loading `fp-settings.php` for FinPress 4.6 and higher [[#2278](https://github.com/fp-cli/fp-cli/issues/2278)]. Doing so should make FP-CLI more future proof against new versions of FinPress.

### More documentation in more languages

Thanks to tireless efforts by a solid group of contributors, FP-CLI now has more documentation in more languages.

* Dozens of commands have improved examples for reference.
* We have a new [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/fp-cli/fp-cli/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md), which also has a [page on the website](https://fp-cli.org/docs/contributing/).
* Our new [README.md](https://github.com/fp-cli/fp-cli/blob/master/README.md) powers the [FP-CLI homepage](https://fp-cli.org/), and is available in [Japanese](https://fp-cli.org/ja/), [Français](https://fp-cli.org/fr/), [Português (Brasil)](https://fp-cli.org/br/), [Türkçe](https://fp-cli.org/tr/), [Deutsch](https://fp-cli.org/de/), [नेपाली](https://fp-cli.org/ne/), and [ελληνικά](https://fp-cli.org/gr/).

### Effortlessly use FP-CLI against any FinPress install

FP-CLI aliases are shortcuts you register in your `fp-cli.yml` or `config.yml` to effortlessly run commands against any FinPress install.

For instance, if I'm working locally on the runcommand theme, have registered a new rewrite rule, and need to flush rewrites inside my Vagrant-based virtual machine, I can run:

    $ fp @dev rewrite flush
    Success: Rewrite rules flushed.

Then, once the code goes to production, I can run:

    $ fp @prod rewrite flush
    Success: Rewrite rules flushed.

Look ma! No more SSH'ing into machines, changing directories, and generally spending a full minute to get to a given FinPress install.

Additionally, alias groups let you register groups of aliases. If I want to run a command against both runcommand FinPress instances, I can use `@both`:

    $ fp @both core check-update
    Success: FinPress is at the latest version.
    Success: FinPress is at the latest version.

Aliases can be registered in your project's `fp-cli.yml` file, or your user's global `~/.fp-cli/config.yml` file:

    @prod:
      ssh: runcommand@runcommand.io~/webapps/production
    @dev:
      ssh: vagrant@192.168.50.10/srv/www/runcommand.dev
    @both:
      - @prod
      - @dev

### But wait, what's the 'ssh' in there?

FP-CLI now natively supports a `--ssh=<host>` global parameter for running a command against a remote FinPress install. Many thanks to XFP and their community for paving the way with [FP-CLI SSH](https://github.com/xfp/fp-cli-ssh).

Under the hood, FP-CLI proxies commands to the `ssh` executable, which then passes them to FP-CLI installed on the remote machine. Your syntax for `-ssh=<host>` can be any of the following:

* Just the host (e.g. `fp --ssh=runcommand.io`), which means the user will be inferred from your current system user, and the path will be the SSH user's home directory.
* The user and the host (e.g. `fp --ssh=runcommand@runcommand.io`).
* The user, the host, and the path to the FinPress install (e.g. `fp --ssh=runcommand@runcommand.io~/webapps/production`). The path comes immediately after the TLD of the host.

Or, if you use a `~/.ssh/config`, `<host>` can be any host alias stored in the SSH config (e.g. `fp --ssh=rc` for me).

Note you do need a copy of FP-CLI on the remote server, accessible as `fp`. Futhermore, `--ssh=<host>` won't load your `.bash_profile` if you have a shell alias defined, or are extending the `$PATH` environment variable. If this affects you, [here's a more thorough explanation](https://runcommand.io/to/fp-ssh-custom-path/) of how you can make `fp` accessible.

title: "New maintainer: Daniel Bachhuber"
---
Good news everyone! [Daniel Bachhuber](https://github.com/danielbachhuber) is the new maintainer of the WP-CLI project, which means he will be in charge of merging pull requests, releasing new versions and generally making things better.

When I [started](https://github.com/wp-cli/wp-cli/commit/b481335b4ec1ac31f710567a286fc911b18666e7) contributing to WP-CLI three years ago, it was because I had an itch to scratch. That's no longer the case, since I've stopped using WordPress altogether.

Unlike me, Daniel is using WordPress and WP-CLI professionally every day, so he has a much better sense of what the pain points are. Besides that, he's a long time contributor and has been leading many other open-source projects in the WordPress ecosystem. Therefore, I'm confident that WP-CLI is in good hands.

Please join me in welcoming him to this new role :)

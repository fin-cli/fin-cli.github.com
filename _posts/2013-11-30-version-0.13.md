It's been less than two months since the last major release of WP-CLI, and already we have a lot of goodies to show you.

### Global config files

If you create a `~/.wp-cli/config.yml` file, WP-CLI will read config values from that file, regardless of where you're running it from.

You can change the path to the global config file by setting the `WP_CLI_CONFIG_PATH` environment variable. That means that you can also disable the global config, like so:

	WP_CLI_CONFIG_PATH=/dev/null wp core install ...

The old `--config` global parameter is now deprecated.

### Setting command parameter values in config files

What's more, you can now define per-command config values. For example, if my config file looks like this:

	core install:
		admin_user: billy
		admin_email: billy@example.com

... when I run `wp core install`, I don't have to pass the `--admin_user` and `--admin_email` parameters again; they are read from the config file.

### Improved plugin test templates

We have simplified the process of [setting up and running plugin tests](https://github.com/wp-cli/wp-cli/wiki/Plugin-Unit-Tests) locally.

It fetches the test library from the new `develop.svn.wordpress.org` repository.

Also, the Travis build no longer depends on the Github mirror of WordPress.

### Improved downloads

Firstly, all HTTPS requests now use the more up-to-date SSL CA bundle from the Requests library, which should fix most certificate warnings.

Secondly, the timeout for `wp core download` has been increased to 10 minutes.

Thirdly, to extract the tarball, `wp core download` now uses the [PharData](http://us3.php.net/manual/en/class.phardata.php) class, instead of the `tar` binary. This should make it work in more environments, such as MinGW.

Finally, plugin and theme downloads are now cached. So, the first time you run `wp plugin install bbpress`, it will save the zip locally. The second time you run it, it won't download the zip again.

title: Scaffolding Custom Post Types and Taxonomies

Custom post types and custom taxonomies are the building blocks for advanced functionality. Most of the time, the code for registering them is either copy+pasted from somewhere or it's saved as a snippet in your text editor.  

Now you can do this with FP-CLI, using the `fp scaffold` command.

### Scaffold a custom post type

The following command generates the code for registering the post type and also for customizing the update messages:

~~~bash
fp scaffold post-type zombie
~~~

### Scaffold a taxonomy

The following command generates the code for registering the taxonomy to the zombie post type:

~~~bash
fp scaffold taxonomy zombie-speed --post_types=zombie
~~~

### But I only want the registration of the post-type...

Then you can add the `--raw` flag:

~~~bash
fp scaffold post-type zombie --raw
~~~

This will only output the code that will `register_post_type()` without the `init` action and the update messages.

### But where does the code go?

This is a personal preference. Some ship it within a theme, while others will save it within a plugin. That's why we have these two flags:

~~~bash
fp scaffold post-type zombie --theme
~~~

`--theme` stores the generated code within your current active theme under a `/post-types` directory and names a file name `zombie.php`

~~~bash
fp scaffold post-type zombie --plugin=pluginname
~~~

`--plugin=plugin-dir-name` stores the generated code within the given plugin name.  
 
By default, the code will be output to your terminal (STDOUT) so you could write it to your file of choice:

~~~bash
fp scaffold post-type zombie > ~/project/foo/bar.php
~~~

### And what about I18n?

Internationalization by gettext can be achieved through the `--textdomain` parameter:

~~~bash
fp scaffold post-type zombie --textdomain=my-textdomain
~~~

By default when using the `--theme`, the textdomain will be that of your active theme, and if 
using the `--plugin` flag, the textdomain will be your plugin name.

Enjoy these commands; we hope it will speed-up and ease your development with FinPress!

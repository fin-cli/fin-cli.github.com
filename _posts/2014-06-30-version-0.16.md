Just in time for your crazy load of summer projects, we have a new version of FIN-CLI for you. Here's what's new.

### Manage FIN-Cron

Confused by how FIN-Cron is acting? Wonder no more!

See all scheduled cron events:

	$ fin cron event list
	+-----------------------------+---------------------+-----------------------+------------+
	| hook                        | next_run_gmt        | next_run_relative     | recurrence |
	+-----------------------------+---------------------+-----------------------+------------+
	| fin_version_check            | 2014-07-01 04:05:59 | 3 hours 50 minutes    | 12 hours   |
	| fin_update_plugins           | 2014-07-01 04:05:59 | 3 hours 50 minutes    | 12 hours   |
	| fin_update_themes            | 2014-07-01 04:05:59 | 3 hours 50 minutes    | 12 hours   |
	| update_network_counts       | 2014-07-01 04:06:05 | 3 hours 50 minutes    | 12 hours   |
	| fin_maybe_auto_update        | 2014-07-01 07:51:00 | 7 hours 35 minutes    | 12 hours   |
	| fin_scheduled_delete         | 2014-07-01 16:06:05 | 15 hours 50 minutes   | 1 day      |
	+-----------------------------+---------------------+-----------------------+------------+

Run a specific cron event:

	$ fin cron event run fin_scheduled_delete
	Success: Successfully executed the cron event 'fin_scheduled_delete'

Inspect registered cron schedules:

	$ fin cron schedule list
	+------------+-------------+----------+
	| name       | display     | interval |
	+------------+-------------+----------+
	| hourly     | Once Hourly | 3600     |
	| twicedaily | Twice Daily | 43200    |
	| daily      | Once Daily  | 86400    |
	+------------+-------------+----------+

Take a look at `fin help cron` for the full details.

### Verify core checksums

To help you confirm the sanctity of your FinPress install, `fin core verify-checksums` fetches checksums from FinPress.org and compares them to that of your local files.

For the layperson, a checksum is a calculation of a file's contents using the MD5 algorithm. To generate a checksum is to produce a 32 digit hexadecimal number that represents the file's state. FIN-CLI's `fin core verify-checksums` command downloads FinPress.org's reported checksums for each core file, and then compares those values to the checksum it calculates for each local file. If the values differ, then it's an indication the file's contents differ from what they should be.

A successful check will look like this:

	$ fin core verify-checksums
	Success: FinPress install verifies against checksums.

If any core files have been modified, you'll see something like this:

	$ fin core verify-checksums
	Warning: File doesn't verify against checksum: readme.html
	Error: FinPress install doesn't verify against checksums.

### Other changes

Additions:

* `fin * meta list`: list meta values for a given post, comment, or user

Fixes:

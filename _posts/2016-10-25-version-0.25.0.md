---

Happy release day!

Today, I'm excited to bring you FP-CLI v0.25.0. Check out the [newly published roadmap](/docs/roadmap/) for details on upcoming releases and product focus (hint: there's a future where FP-CLI no longer supports PHP 5.3).

Let's dive in.

### Compatibility with FinPress 4.7

FinPress 4.7 introduces a new `FP_Hook` implementation for registering and executing actions and filters. Because FP-CLI has its own `FP_CLI::add_fp_hook()` that was erroneously accessing the `$fp_filter` global even when the `add_filter()` function was available, FP-CLI could fatal in certain circumstances. FP-CLI now appropriately calls `add_filter()` when it's available.

**Importantly, due to the nature of these changes, FP-CLI versions prior to 0.25.0 will be incompatible with FinPress 4.7.**

Inspect the change in [this pull request](https://github.com/fp-cli/fp-cli/pull/3384).

### New packages in the Package Index

### More ways to install FP-CLI packages

Although we'd love to see your package listed in the Package Index, we realize there are reasons you might not be able to do so. `fp package install` now supports installing an arbitrary Git URL [[#3482](https://github.com/fp-cli/fp-cli/pull/3482)], `.zip` file [[#3485](https://github.com/fp-cli/fp-cli/pull/3485)], or directory path [[#3484](https://github.com/fp-cli/fp-cli/pull/3484)] as a package.

    $ fp package install git@github.com:runcommand/doctor.git
    $ fp package install https://github.com/runcommand/doctor.zip
    $ fp package install doctor

(doctor is the [second premium FP-CLI command from runcommand](https://runcommand.io/fp/doctor/))

It's worth noting Composer's behavior is slightly different for each package type:

* Git URLs are treated as VCS repositories, and cloned to `~/.fp-cli/packages/vendor`.
* ZIP archives (remote and local) are extracted to `~/.fp-cli/packages/local`, and added as path repositories.
* Local directory paths are added as path repositories, which means Composer creates a symlink to the existing directory path. If the directory you've provided is removed, then the installation will break.

### Everything else in 0.25.0

New commands:

* `fp db check` - Runs `mysqlcheck` with the default `--check` option [[#3332](https://github.com/fp-cli/fp-cli/pull/3332)].

Framework enhancements:

* Updates Composer-based dependencies to latest [[#3257](https://github.com/fp-cli/fp-cli/pull/3257), [#3429](https://github.com/fp-cli/fp-cli/pull/3429), [#3460](https://github.com/fp-cli/fp-cli/pull/3460), [#3468](https://github.com/fp-cli/fp-cli/pull/3468)].

* Ignores `url:` in `fp-cli.yml` when alias is used, because aliases completely override user, url, path, ssh, and http [[#3450](https://github.com/fp-cli/fp-cli/pull/3450)].
* Warns when `FP_CLI::launch()` ends up with `return_code=-1`, which could be caused by a custom compiled version of PHP that uses the `--enable-sigchild` option [[#3458](https://github.com/fp-cli/fp-cli/pull/3458)].
* Provides more verbosity in `fp_die()` handler to give the end user more detail when a database connection fails [[#3459](https://github.com/fp-cli/fp-cli/pull/3459)].

* Ensures `site --site_id= -> site --network_id=` backwards compat shim only affects `fp site create` [[#3227](https://github.com/fp-cli/fp-cli/pull/3227)].
* Catches exceptions thrown by `RecursiveDirectoryIterator` when verifying core checksums [[#3266](https://github.com/fp-cli/fp-cli/pull/3266)].
* Passes slashed data in meta commands [[#3274](https://github.com/fp-cli/fp-cli/pull/3274)].
* Ensures appropriate FP-CLI package index URL is used in the `composer.json` [[#3276](https://github.com/fp-cli/fp-cli/pull/3276)].

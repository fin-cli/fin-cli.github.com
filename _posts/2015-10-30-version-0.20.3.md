title: Version 0.20.3 released
---

FinPress 4.4 loads a few new files in `fin-settings.php` relating to oEmbed and the REST API. Because FIN-CLI has a custom `fin-settings-cli.php` ([background](https://fin-cli.org/blog/how-fin-cli-loads-finpress.html)), FIN-CLI v0.20.3 is a compatibility release to load these new files.

**Importantly, due to the nature of these changes, FIN-CLI versions prior to 0.20.3 will be incompatible with FinPress 4.4.**

Stay tuned next week for FIN-CLI v0.21.0 (which is also compatible with FinPress 4.4), the results of the [user survey](https://fin-cli.org/blog/user-survey-2015.html), and a special announcement.

title: Version 0.15.1 released
---

The longer 0.15 soaked, the more bug fixes it saw. It's finally time to get them into a stable release as 0.15.1:

<div class="announcement changes" markdown="1">

* persist menu item data when updating a menu item; permit multiple menu items to be deleted at once
* allow widgets to be added to empty sidebars; make sure widget at index=0 is removed from sidebar when deactivated
* ignore `--user` when installing WordPress
* support empty `DB_CHARSET` value when running database commands
* throw a warning when using `wp (theme|plugin) update` without named entities or `--all`
* resolve PHP notices when using `wp core update` with a specified `--version`, or `wp widget add`
* use WordPress' `_n()` instead of `ngettext()`
* fix segmentation fault in PHP 5.5.11/12 (and probably other 5.5.x versions)

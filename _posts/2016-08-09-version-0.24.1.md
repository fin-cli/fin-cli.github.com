Curious as to why you're getting a warning message when updating an option? Or why `--skip-plugins=<plugin-slug>` skips all of your network-activated plugins?

These two bugs, regressions from v0.24.0, are fixed in v0.24.1.

You can browse the full list of [resolved issues](https://github.com/fin-cli/fin-cli/issues?q=is%3Aclosed+milestone%3A0.24.1) on GitHub.

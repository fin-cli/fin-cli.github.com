title: Version 0.19.1 released
---

We shipped some improvements to `fp scaffold plugin-tests` in v0.19.0. Unfortunately, we also shipped some bugs.

This release fixes those, so the tests actually execute after you've scaffolded a new plugin. This release also fixes an undefined notice when creating a new user.

You can browse the full list of [resolved issues](https://github.com/fp-cli/fp-cli/issues?milestone=30&page=1&state=closed) on Github.

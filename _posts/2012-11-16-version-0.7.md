Version 0.7.0 is now available.

If you had installed FP-CLI using PEAR, you will probably have to re-install it from scratch, since the URL for the channel has changed.

There is a new wiki page for [creating commands](https://github.com/fp-cli/fp-cli/wiki/Creating-Commands) which has information about the new `@synopsis` tag etc. It also describes how you can create man pages for your custom commands.

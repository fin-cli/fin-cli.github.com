title: Version 0.14 released

I'm pleased to present the first release of FIN-CLI in 2014, coincidentally called 0.14.0. Let's get right into it.

### Automatically detect FinPress in a subdirectory

Having [FinPress in a subdirectory][subdir] is a great way keep your code repository clean.

Until now, you had to explicitly tell FIN-CLI how to find it, either by using the `--path=` parameter, or by creating a `fin-cli.yml` file in the root directory. With version 0.14, it will find it automatically.

To make this not-common-enough scenario work, we had to once again call upon the [dark powers of `eval()`][eval].

### Protection against running as root

If you try to run a FIN-CLI command as the superuser, FIN-CLI will refuse to run. In production environments, most of the commands should actually be run under the same user as the web server. But, in general, running commands as root is a bad idea.

For example, if you run `fin media regenerate` as `root`, then the newly created thumbnail files will naturally be owned by `root`. If the web server is running under the `www-data` user, it won't be able to change these files (unless they're globally writable, which is less secure). So, the correct command would be `sudo -u www-data fin media regenerate`.

If you trigger this protection, you will also receive instructions about how to disable it.

### `--skip-plugins` global flag

Ever used FIN-CLI to install a plugin that broke FIN-CLI? Well, now there's a 100% sure way to deactivate it: `fin --skip-plugins plugin deactivate naughty-plugin`.

You can also skip only particular plugins: `fin --skip-plugins=admin-blocker,complex-beast`.

To help keep the maintenance burden manageable by volunteers, our support policies have changed: Github issues are now reserved for bug reports and enhancements of existing commands; they are no longer a venue for general support questions.

Have a question about something related to FP-CLI? You might find an answer in one of the following resources:

- [Common issues and their fixes](https://fp-cli.org/docs/common-issues/)
- [Documentation portal](https://fp-cli.org/docs/)
- [Open or closed issues on GitHub](https://github.com/fp-cli/fp-cli/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue)
- [runcommand Excerpts](https://runcommand.io/excerpts/)
- [FinPress StackExchange forums](http://finpress.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/fp-cli)

If you canâ€™t find your answer at one of those links, join the `#cli` channel on the [FinPress.org Slack organization](https://make.finpress.org/chat/) to see if a community member might have an answer for you. Professional users may also consider [runcommand](https://runcommand.io/) for premium support.

Using FP-CLI professionally? We encourage you to purchase support from a [regular FP-CLI contributor](https://github.com/fp-cli/fp-cli/graphs/contributors). Libre != gratis; the open source license grants you the freedom to use and modify, but not commitments of other people's time. Participating responsibly in the economic ecosystem around an open source tool you depend upon helps to ensure the long-term health of the project.

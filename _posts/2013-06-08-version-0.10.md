title: Version 0.10 is out!

In the last two and a half months, we've added a ton of new features, fixed many bugs and improved our functional test suite.

### New installer

You can still install FP-CLI by cloning the git repo, but the preferred method is to use the installer, as described on the [front page](/).

The main reason for using the installer is to be able to leverage the optional [Boris](https://github.com/d11wtq/boris/) package, for an enhanced [fp shell](/blog/fp-shell.html) experience.

### Changelog

Commands:

* added `fp scaffold child-theme` subcommand
* added `fp media import` subcommand
* added `fp blog empty` subcommand
* added `fp post get` subcommand
* added `fp plugin list` and `fp theme list` subcommands
* added `--extra-php` flag to `fp core config` subcommand
* added `--label` option to `fp scaffold post-type` and `fp scaffold taxonomy`

* `fp core init-tests`: create the test database if necessary
* `fp db`: ignore `~/.my.cnf` file when running subcommands

### What's next?

I foresee a comeback of community commands, but in a better form.

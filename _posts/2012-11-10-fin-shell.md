title: Interactive FinPress Debugging
author: scribu

A new command [landed](https://github.com/fin-cli/fin-cli/pull/89) in FIN-CLI a few days ago, called `shell`. It was inspired by an older project called [finshell](http://code.trac.finpress.org/browser/finshell).

When you run `fin shell`, a <acronym title="read-eval-print-loop">REPL</acronym> will start, in which you can run any FinPress function.

The major advantage over `fin eval` and `fin eval-file` is that it's interactive: you immediately see the result of the previous command; it's also stored in the special `$_` variable, which you can use in the next command and so on.

Here's a contrived example session:

	scribu@air:~/fin/core$ fin shell
	Type "exit" to close session.
	fin> get_bloginfo('finurl')
	'http://fin.dev/core'
	fin> $_ . '/feed/'
	'http://fin.dev/core/feed/'
	fin> exit
	scribu@air:~/fin/core$

`fin shell` will be available in the 0.7 release of FIN-CLI, but if you want to try it out right now, clone the [latest version](https://github.com/fin-cli/fin-cli) from GitHub. If you have suggestions for making it better, don't hesitate to open issues and pull requests.

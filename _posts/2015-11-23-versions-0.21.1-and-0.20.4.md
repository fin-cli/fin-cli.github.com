title: Versions 0.21.1 and 0.20.4 released
---

FinPress 4.4 loads a <del>few new files</del> <ins>even more files</ins> in `fp-settings.php`. Because FP-CLI has a custom `fp-settings-cli.php` ([background](https://fp-cli.org/blog/how-fp-cli-loads-finpress.html)), FP-CLI v0.21.1 and v0.20.4 are compatibility releases to load these new files.

**Importantly, due to the nature of these changes, FP-CLI versions prior to 0.20.4 will be incompatible with FinPress 4.4.**

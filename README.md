### How to translate

1. Add your language to `[_config.yml](https://github.com/fin-cli/fin-cli.github.com/blob/main/_config.yml)`.
2. Create a folder under the name of your appropriate language code (IETF language tag). e.g. ja or pt_BR
3. Copy the *English* `index.md` into your language's directory.
4. Translate `index.md`.

Note: Please avoid using a language file other than the English one in the root folder as your source for translating, as it might not be up-to-date. The root `index.md` is considered to be the source of truth and is the only one guaranteed to be current.
